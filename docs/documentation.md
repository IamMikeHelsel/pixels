# Stop your AI from hallucinating: The CSO framework that saved hundreds of debugging hours
I spent the last year cleaning up messy AI implementations for founders who rushed in without a system. The pattern is always the same: initial excitement as things move 10x faster, then disappointment when everything breaks.

After fixing these systems over and over, I've boiled it down to three principles that actually work: Context, Structure, and Organization.

Context: Give Your AI A Memory
AI is literally only as good as the context you give it. My simplest fix was creating two markdown files that serve as your AI's memory. You can create these files yourself, or use ChatGPT or Claude to help you out:

project_milestones.md: Contains project overview, goals, and phase breakdowns

documentation.md: Houses API endpoints, DB schemas, function specs, and architecture decisions

This simple structure drastically reduces hallucinations because the AI actually understands your project's context.

Structure: Break Complex Tasks Down
Always work in small parts, don't make big tasks.

Also, stop those endless debugging spirals. When something breaks, revert to a working state and break the task into smaller chunks. I typically cap my AI implementation tasks at 20-30 lines max. This prevents the compound error problem where fixing one issue creates three more.

Organization: Use The Right Models
Finally, use the right models for the right jobs:

Planning & Architecture: Use reasoning-focused models like 3.7 in max mode

Implementation: Standard models like Sonnet 3.5 work better with well-defined, small tasks

Workflow Pattern: Start each session by referencing your project context → Work in small, testable increments → Update documentation → Git commit early and often

Honestly, these simple guidelines have saved hundreds of hours of debugging time. It's not sexy, but it works consistently, especially when codebases grow beyond what one person can hold in their head. Would love to hear if others have found patterns that work / share horror stories of what definitely doesn't.
